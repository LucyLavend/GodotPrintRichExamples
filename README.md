![In-editor screenshot of examples useses of the print rich function in Godot](Screenshots/ExamplesPrintRich.png)

This is the project I used to show off the usecases of print_rich() in my [Youtube video about this topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSaczr74LzU).

## Animated image creator

I've included a script that lets you generate an AnimatedTexture resource from all the images in a selected folder.

Put this script on a node (already present in main.tscn), set the properties in the inspector and hit generate. Then you can view and save the output from the inspector using the dropdown menu on the output resource.

You can use sites like [ezgif.com](https://ezgif.com/) to extract all the frames from a gif
